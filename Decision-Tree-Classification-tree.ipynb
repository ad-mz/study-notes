    "To understand how this formula works, let's walk through an example.  \n",
    "Given the following orange partition with two possible outcomes, red triangle and green circle. To calculate the entropy of the partition, we first multiply the negative proportion of examples that belong to the triangle class by the binary log of the proportion itself. How do we get 0.53? There are 30 examples in the partition, and 16 of them belong to the triangle class. Therefore, the proportion of examples in the triangle class is 16 divided by 30, which is 0.53. Next, we multiply the negative proportion of examples that belong to the circle class by the binary log of the proportion itself. And how do we get 0.47? 14 out of 30 examples belong to the circle class. 0.47 is 14 divided by 30. Adding the two products yields 0.997. This is the entropy of the orange partition. \n",

    "So how does the classification tree algorithm use entropy to decide where to split the data during the recursive partitioning process? Let's assume that a classification tree algorithm is considering where to split this data in order to create pure partitions. One of the choices it has to make is whether a split on loan amount of $40,000 is the best split it could make. To figure this out, the algorithm starts by calculating the entropy of the left partition, which yields 0.986. Then it calculates the entropy of the right partition, which yields 0.951. The gray partition accounts for 47% of the data, while the yellow partition accounts for 53%. The combined entropy of both partitions after the split is a weighted sum of their individual entropy values, which is 0.47, times the entropy of the left partition, 0.986, plus 0.53 times the entropy of the right partition, 0.951. This comes out to 0.967. 0.967 is the combined entropy of the left and right partitions after the data is split on loan amount of $40,000. \n",
