    "In summary, regression trees are a type of decision tree. In a regression tree, each leaf represents a numeric value. We determine how to divide the observations by trying different thresholds and calculating the sum of squared residuals at each step.\n",
    "The threshold with the smallest sum of squared residuals becomes a candidate for the root of the tree. If we have more than one predictor, we find the optimal threshold for each one and pick the candidate with the smallest sum of squared residuals to be the root.\n",
    "When we have fewer than some minimum number of observations in a node — 7 in this example, but more commonly 20 — then that node becomes a leaf. Otherwise, we repeat the process to split the remaining observations until we can no longer split the observations into smaller groups. And then we are done."
